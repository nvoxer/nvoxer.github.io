RUNNING
~~~~~~~
You can start ACDSee from the Program Manager by double-clicking on its icon. 
You will immediately be presented with the Image Browser dialog where you can 
browse your directories for images to look at.

If you have made a File Manager association between image files and ACDSee, 
you can also start ACDSee from the File Manager by just double clicking on 
an image file. 

You can supply one or more image files as the command-line arguments to 
ACDSee.  You can even use wildcards.  e.g., acdsee.exe *.jpg would start 
ACDSee and have it slideshow all the files in the current directory.

In addition, you may specify a startup directory on the command line.  
The directory name must end in a "\", or be one of ".", "..", r "<drive>:".  
ACDSee will start the Image Browser in the specified directory.


       	See the file ACDSEE.HLP for more details.
