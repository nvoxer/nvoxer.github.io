Subsequent notepads are added to the taskbar as similar icons, but using 
green, blue and red icons.  The pads can be used for different subjects or
by different users.

Click the LEFT mouse button on the yellow Forgot-It Taskbar icon to open the
Forgot-It window.

a configuration menu.

When open, each Forgot-It window can cycle through 10 different pages.
Click on the left and right arrows next to the page number to cycle
through the pages.  You can also click on the page number to pull down
menu of pages

You can open up to 4 different Forgot-It windows.  Right click on the task bar
icon, then select 'New' to open each additional Forgot-it window.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Forgot-It will allow you to set alarms. To set an alarm, insert, in the note,
the DATE that you want the alarm to activate, as follows:

@01/12/96 (European format)
or
@12.01.96 (U.S.A. format)

The note will appear with an alert box when the day is reached. (The examples
above will generate an alarm on December 1, 1996.)
Then Forgot-It will replace the '@' symbol with the '#' symbol indicating
that the date for the alarm has passed.

When the alarm occurs, an alert box is displayed, with the text following the alarm.
i.e @01/12/96 Essai d'alarme (Using the European date format)

To set a specific time for the alarm, you must follow the alarm date immediately by
the alarm time as -HH:MM (hours and minutes in 24 hour clock format).  For example 
'-13:01' will make alarm occur at 13hours 01 mins...

Example :
@12.01.96-14:30 will alarm on the First December 96, at 14h30 (2:30pm)


---------------------------------------------------------------------

If you don't want the Forgot-It icon to appear on the Taskbar when the
Forgot-It Window is open, you can remove it.
To do this, edit POSTIT.INI (in the Windows directory), and add the
following line in the [Post-It] section:

ToolWindow=1

When you restart Forgot-It, the Forgot-It Icon will not appear in the Taskbar,
and the menu bar on the open Forgot-It window will be a little smaller.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

About color selection :

Windows doesn't enable all colors for the Edit-Windows...Only non-dithered colors
can be used for Edit-Windows whether you are in 16colors or 256colors mode.
If you select a bad color for Forgot-It, you will get 2 background colors in the
edit window: one where text appears, and another where there is only background...
(Difficult to explain : Try by yourself...  Right click on the taskbar icon then select
'Colors') 

You can only select one color scheme for the notepads.  You can't select 
different colors for each of the notepads, if you use more than one.  However, Each is
color-coded by its task bar icon color and a corresponding colored square at the top
left of its window.
