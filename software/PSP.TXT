Paint Shop Pro 4.1


Fees for Distribution of Shareware Versions

Disk Vendors, Shareware Distributors and BBS(s) may have charged a nominal fee for the distribution of this Shareware version of Paint Shop Pro. This fee does not constitute payment for the Licensed version of Paint Shop Pro, and does not entitle the end user to use the shareware version for longer than the 30 day evaluation period.


Definition of Shareware

Shareware distribution gives users a chance to try software before buying it. If you try a Shareware program and continue using it, you are required to register it (or purchase the licensed version as in the case of Paint Shop Pro).

Copyright laws apply to both Shareware and retail software, and the copyright holder retains all rights, with a few specific exceptions as stated below. Shareware authors are accomplished programmers, just like retail authors, and the programs are of comparable quality. (In both cases, there are good programs and bad ones!) The main difference is in the method of distribution. The author specifically grants the right to copy and distribute the software, either to all and sundry or to a specific group. For example, some authors require written permission before a commercial disk vendor may copy their Shareware.

Shareware is a distribution method, not a type of software. You should find software that suits your needs and pocketbook, whether it's retail or Shareware. The Shareware system makes fitting your needs easier, because you can try before you buy. And because the overhead is lower, prices are lower also. Shareware has the ultimate money-back guarantee -- if you don't use the product, you don't pay for it.


ASP Ombudsman Policy

This program is produced by a member of the Association of Shareware Professionals (ASP).  ASP wants to make sure that the shareware principle works for you. If you are unable to resolve a shareware-related problem with an ASP member by contacting the member directly, ASP may be able to help. The ASP Ombudsman can help you resolve a dispute or problem with an ASP member, but does not provide technical support for members' products. Please write to the ASP Ombudsman at 545 Grover Road, Muskegon, MI 49442-9427 or send a CompuServe message via CompuServe Mail to ASP Ombudsman 70007,3536

Installing Paint Shop Pro

Before you can use Paint Shop Pro you have to run the Paint Shop Pro setup program from Windows so it will work properly on your computer. You cannot just copy the files from the Paint Shop Pro disk to your hard disk.  The files on the distribution disk are compressed to save space. The setup program unpacks those files and builds them on your working disk.

1) If Windows 95 / Windows NT 4.0 isn't running, start it now.
2) If installing from diskette, insert the Paint Shop Pro disk 1 into the appropriate floppy drive.
3) Click on the Start button on the Taskbar. Windows will open the Start menu.
4) Click on the Start menu's "Run" selection. Windows will open the "Run" dialog box.
5) If installing from a floppy drive type the drive letter of the floppy drive containing the Paint Shop Pro files followed by ":\SETUP.EXE", or if you have downloaded Paint Shop Pro, type the path to the unzipped files followed by "\SETUP.EXE".
6) Click on the "OK" button. Windows will run the Paint Shop Pro setup program.
7) Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the installation.


The User's Manual

In order to keep the size of the Shareware version of Paint Shop Pro reasonable, no printable user's manual has been provided. You will find that help for ALL menu items and associated dialog boxes, along with general information, is provided in the on-line help system.

When you purchase the licensed version of Paint Shop Pro you will receive the fully illustrated, perfect bound User's Guide.

Command-Line Arguments

Command line options are available that allow Paint Shop Pro to start a browser window automatically upon startup.  The command:

PSP.EXE [/Browse] <dirname>

will start a browser window for the directory specified in dirname, or will pop up a dialog asking for the directory to browse if no directory is specified on the command line.

You may also start a browser session by simply specifying a directory name on the command line instead of an image file name.  This allows a shortcut to Paint Shop Pro to be placed into the "Windows/Send To" directory for Explorer-based browsing.
